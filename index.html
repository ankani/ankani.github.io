		<p> Currently, I work as a Data Science Engineer with the AV Behavior Testing team at NVIDIA. Previously I was a data research engineer at Perceptive Automata, a Boston-based startup. My work aimed at improving and increasing safety of autonomous driving outcomes around pedestrians in crowded and complicated urban environments. 
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>Before joining Perceptive Automata, I was a <strong>postdoctoral fellow</strong> and a <strong>graduate student</strong> with <strong><a href="https://www2.bcs.rochester.edu/sites/haefnerlab/index.html">Ralf Haefner</a></strong> in the department of <strong>Brain and Cognitive Sciences</strong> at <strong>University of Rochester</strong>. 
<br>
<br>
For PhD, my research involved understanding the computational mechanisms underlying perceptual biases, action selection biases and confidence judgements, especially in the visual domain. I have also worked towards building a bio-physically realistic network of neurons that can implement sampling based probabilistic inference. I led and delivered research projects: starting from formulation of testable scientific hypotheses, to designing psychophysical experiments, executing the experiments on human subjects and collecting data, analyzing the data using statistical and mathematical tools and finally modeling the empirical observations using concepts from machine learning.
<br>
<br>
I am good at building connections with people and always excited to learn new things. I enjoy working in collaboration with cross-functional team of researchers and strongly advocate for collective success. In my free time I enjoy painting and cooking. I have performed Indian music and dance  in multiple charity and social events in and around Rochester. I speak Bengali and Hindi besides English. I love to travel, see new places and meet new people.
