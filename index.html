		<p> Currently I am a data research engineer at Perceptive Automata, a Boston-based startup. My work aims at improving and increasing safety of autonomous driving outcomes around pedestrians in crowded and complicated urban environments. I analyze and evaluate deep learning model performance, robustness and failure modes for complicated urban driving scenarios.I also develop quantifiable metrics and analysis pipeline for evaluation of experiments aimed at understanding pedestrian behaviors, to improve customerâ€™s AV and ADAS safety and social driving capabilities. I closely collaborate with the product and development team to help with customer engagement. 
			<br>
			<p>Before joining Perceptive Automata I was a postdoctoral fellow and a graduate student with <strong><a href="https://www2.bcs.rochester.edu/sites/haefnerlab/index.html">Ralf Haefner</a></strong> in the department of <strong>Brain and Cognitive Sciences</strong> at <strong>University of Rochester</strong>. 
<br>
During PhD, my research involved understanding the computational mechanisms underlying perceptual biases, action selection biases and confidence judgements, especially in the visual domain. I have also worked towards building a bio-physically realistic network of neurons that can implement sampling based probabilistic inference.
<br>
I am very passionate about making scientific contributions towards social good. I have thus worked on projects to develop a fair rating predictor system for public speaking with respect to speakers race and gender and also developed a spatial crime prediction model for Rochester.
<br>
<br>
My strength lies in building end to end research projects using <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>MATLAB</strong>: starting from formulation of testable scientific hypotheses, to designing psychophysical experiments, executing the experiments on human subjects and collecting data, analyzing the data using statistical and mathematical tools and finally modeling the empirical observations using concepts from machine learning.
<br>
<br>
I am good at building connections with people and always excited to learn new things. I enjoy working in collaboration and strongly advocate for collective success. 
<br>
<br>
In my free time I enjoy painting and cooking. I have performed Indian music and dance  in multiple charity and social events in and around Rochester. I speak Bengali and Hindi besides English. I love to travel, see new places and meet new people.
