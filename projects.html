		For my PhD thesis, my broad scientific aim is to understand the mechanisms in the brain underlying formation of visual percepts, perceptual beliefs about the outside world, temporal and spatial perceptual biases, biases in action selection and seeking new information and meta-cognitive confidence judgements. 
		<br>
		<br>
		I study this in the context of probabilistic inferences in the brain about the outside world by combining sensory information and prior knowledge about the structure of the external world. I design perceptual decision making expeirments for humans with the goal to understand perceptual biases in human behavior as a consequence of sampling-based approximate inference on a hierarchical generative model of the world that the brain has previously learnt. Finally, I aim to investigate if biophysically realistic neurons can implement sampling based inference, bridging all of Marrs three levels, from assuming a computational goal (probabilistic inference over visual inputs) to an algorithm (neural sampling) to neural implementation (network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons LIF neurons).
		<br>
		<br> 
		I am passionate about working on projects that involve social good such fairness and crime prediction and also enjoy working on machine learning projects investigating theory motivated applications.

        <div>
            <p>-- Understanding the primacy and recency biases empirically observed in temporal weighting of evidence in integration tasks. We designed a visual 2-alternative forced choice based discrimination task, developed a hierarchical generative model of the task and simulated sampling based approximate inference to explain and understand various temporal perceptual biases in visual decision making. <a href="papers/Preprint/MainConfirmationBiasPaper.pdf" target="_blank">Paper</a></p>

            <p>-- Using the same paradigm to investigate how spatial and temporal statistics of the stimuli influence the nature and magnitude of temporal perceptual bias in visual decision making. <a href="papers/CCN2019ConfirmationBiasExtension.pdf" target="_blank">Paper</a></p>

        <div>
            <p>-- Understanding how perceptual biases and meta-cognitive confidence judgements about correctness of a choice made in decision making tasks are related. We study this especially in the context of predictions from our sampling based approximate inference. <a href="papers/Preprint/CogSci2021Confidence.pdf" target="_blank">Paper</a></p>

        <div>
            <p>-- Extending the idea of understanding bias in temporal weighting of evidence to understanding biases while seeking new evidence before making a choice. We specifically study whether humans are biased to saccade to evidence favoring their current belief about the correct answer in a trial. <a href="papers/Preprint/CogSci2021ExternalCB.pdf" target="_blank">Paper</a></p>

        <div>
            <p>-- Proposed a novel heterogeneity based metric to quantify quality of a speech in multimodal domain (verbal: transcript and non-verbal: facial gesture) and incorporated it into a fair rating prediction for speakers of TED talks. <a href="papers/Preprint/VaryFairyTED.pdf" target="_blank">Paper</a></p>
